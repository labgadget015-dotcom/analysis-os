```

### Example Recommendation
```
**Recommendation 1: Dominate the 50-200 Employee SMB Segment**

**Rationale:**
- We already have 78% market share in 50-100 employee segment
- Adjacent 100-200 segment is underserved (no clear leader)
- 15,000 companies in target geography, growing 8%/year
- Competitors focused on enterprise, leaving SMB underserved

**Strategy:**
1. **Product**: Add 3 "SMB Pro" features competitors lack
   - Automated onboarding (vs manual setup)
   - Industry templates (vs blank slate)
   - Phone support (vs email-only)

2. **Pricing**: Maintain $49/user, add $199/mo "Pro" tier
   - 20% higher than current, 60% cheaper than enterprise alternatives
   - Bundle features companies need as they scale

3. **Marketing**: "Built for Growing Companies"
   - Target companies at 40-60 employees (about to scale)
   - Case studies from successful 50-100 employee customers
   - Content: "How to scale from 50 to 200 employees"

**Expected Impact:**
- Capture 40% of 100-200 employee segment (vs current 15%)
- Additional 2,400 customers × $58 ARPU = $139K MRR = $1.67M ARR
- Increased brand awareness in core segment
- Defensible moat before competitors notice

**Implementation:**
- Q1: Build 3 SMB Pro features ($180K dev cost)
- Q2: Launch Pro tier, migrate existing customers
- Q3: Marketing campaign ($50K budget)
- Q4: Scale based on results

**Total Investment:** $230K
**Expected Return:** $1.67M ARR = 7.3x ROI in year 1
