#### Why It Works
**Evidence from Analysis:**
- Finding 1: [Specific data point with numbers]
- Finding 2: [Specific data point with numbers]
- Finding 3: [Specific data point with numbers]

**Root Cause:**
[Explain the underlying reason this will work]

#### Expected Impact

**Quantified Benefits:**
- **Primary Metric:** [Current X] → [Target Y] = [Z% improvement]
- **Secondary Metric:** [Current A] → [Target B] = [C% improvement]
- **Financial Impact:** $[Amount] over [timeframe]
  - Calculation: [Show your math]

## Prioritization Framework

### Impact vs Effort Matrix

```
High Impact  │  [Rec 2]  │  [Rec 1]  │  Do First
             │           │           │
Medium Impact│  [Rec 4]  │  [Rec 3]  │  Do Next
             │           │           │
Low Impact   │  Skip     │  Maybe    │  Do Last
             └───────────┴───────────┘
               High        Low
                   Effort
```

### Recommended Sequence

**Phase 1 (Immediate - Weeks 1-4): Quick Wins**
- Recommendation #[X] - ROI: [Y]x
- Recommendation #[Z] - ROI: [A]x

**Phase 2 (Short-term - Weeks 5-12): High Impact**
- Recommendation #[B]
- Recommendation #[C]

**Phase 3 (Long-term - Months 4-6): Strategic**
- Recommendation #[D]
